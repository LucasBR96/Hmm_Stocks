# Hmm_Stocks

This is a personal project of Mine where I used Hidden Markov Models( HMMs ) and Neural Networks to predict the
prices of stocks. the initial idea was to build a bot that used HMMs to write Poetry, but that ended up to be too
complicated for my skill level. Thus I decided to recycle most of the code and use in this project.

This project is educational in nature, feel free to download, study and play with it. I am a beginner, so please be kind
and patient if you dislike the coding style or the documentation.
